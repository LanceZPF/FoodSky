## Introduction
FoodSky is a foundamental LLM specifically designed for the world of food, marking a significant step forward in food computing. As the first Chinese LLM built just for food-related topics, FoodSky uses a vast collection of food data called FoodEarth, which includes everything from recipes to nutritional information, sourced from trusted books and websites. This model isn't just about handling huge amounts of data‚Äîit‚Äôs smart in understanding and discussing food like a professional. Whether it's passing chefs' exams or providing diet advice, FoodSky shows impressive skills, making it a reliable resource for anyone in the food industry, from chefs to dietitians. Its aim is to make working with food more creative and healthy, helping users across various scenarios with accurate and culturally aware advice. This tool is set to change how we interact with food information, blending detailed food knowledge with cutting-edge technology to better serve food enthusiasts and professionals alike.
